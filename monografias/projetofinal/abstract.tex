This work was carried through with intention to compare and to evaluate four of the main techniques of limiarization and image segmentation, applied to the picture processing of wooden stack photos, as solution for the calculation of piling factors.  Between these techniques, we considered the segmentation based in the use of the Non Extensive Entropy, also known as Tsallis Entropy \cite{Tsallis_1988,Tsallis_1999,Tsallis_2001}, applied to this problem.  For this, we had been implemented each one of the tested techniques through a software that was developed.  Tests with photos of stacks manually piled up on the ground had been made; and the results of each technique had been compared with the manual measures  made in field.  The objective of this work is, through the results of the experiments, to verify which of the tested algorithms adjusts better to the automatic calculation of the piling factors, using image segmentation.

%This work was carried through with intention to compare and to evaluate four amongst the diverse techniques of limiarization and segmentation of images, applied to the picture processing of wooden stack photos, as solution for the calculation of piling factors.  Between these techniques, we considered  the segmentation carried through the use of the Not Extensive Entropy, also known as Tsallis Entropy \cite{Tsallis_1988}, applied to this problem.  For this, they had been implemented each one of the tested techniques through a small software that was developed.  Tests with photos of stacks manually on the ground had been carried through; and the results of each technique had been compared with the carried through manual measurements in field.  The objective of this work is, through the carried through experiments, to get for the process of segmentation of images, a precise result in the calculation of the piling factors and to suggest which of the tested algorithms adjusts better to the considered problem.
